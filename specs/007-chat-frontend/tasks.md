# Tasks: Chat Frontend

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-chat-frontend/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-client.yaml, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - focusing on implementation tasks only

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each feature.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Frontend: `frontend/src/`
- Tests: `frontend/tests/`
- All paths relative to repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and verification of existing structure

- [x] T001 Verify Next.js 14+ is installed in frontend environment with App Router support
- [x] T002 Verify TypeScript 5.x and Tailwind CSS 3.x are configured in frontend/
- [ ] T003 Verify backend APIs are accessible (POST /api/auth/login, POST /api/auth/register, POST /api/chat)
- [x] T004 Create environment variables template at frontend/.env.example with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
- [x] T005 Verify frontend/src/ directory structure exists (app/, components/, lib/, context/)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core types and utilities that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story implementation can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Create TypeScript types in frontend/src/lib/types/auth.ts
  - User interface (id, email)
  - LoginRequest, RegisterRequest, AuthResponse interfaces
  - UserSession interface (token, user, isAuthenticated, isLoading, error)
  - NOTE: Already exists from Phase II implementation

- [x] T007 Create TypeScript types in frontend/src/lib/types/chat.ts
  - MessageRole type ('user' | 'assistant')
  - MessageStatus type ('sending' | 'sent' | 'error')
  - Message interface (id, role, content, timestamp, status)
  - ChatState interface (messages, isLoading, error, inputValue)

- [x] T008 Create TypeScript types in frontend/src/lib/types/api.ts
  - ApiError interface (error, detail)
  - Generic API response types

- [x] T009 Create base API client in frontend/src/lib/api/client.ts
  - ApiClient class with request interceptors
  - Automatic Authorization header injection
  - Error handling for 401 (SESSION_EXPIRED), network errors, 500 errors
  - get() and post() methods with TypeScript generics
  - NOTE: Already exists from Phase II implementation with advanced features

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - User Authentication (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to authenticate with the system before accessing the AI chat interface to ensure secure, personalized task management

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Basic Chat Interaction (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to send natural language messages to the AI assistant and receive responses to manage tasks through conversation

  - Test keyboard navigation flow

**Checkpoint**: All 6 user stories should now be independently functional

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user story implementations
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Authentication**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Basic Chat**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (but requires US1 for authentication)
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Message History**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US2 components
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Error Handling**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 and US2 components
- **User Story 5 (P3) - Responsive Mobile**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances all components
- **User Story 6 (P3) - Accessibility**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances all components

### Within Each User Story

- Component implementations can run in parallel (different files)
- Page implementations depend on component completion
- Context providers should be implemented before components that use them

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T005) can run in parallel
- Phase 2 tasks (T006-T009) can run in parallel (different files)
- Once Phase 2 completes, user story implementations can start in parallel:
  - T010-T018 (US1 Authentication) || T019-T027 (US2 Basic Chat) || T028-T030 (US3 Message History) || T031-T035 (US4 Error Handling) || T036-T040 (US5 Responsive) || T041-T047 (US6 Accessibility)
- All Polish tasks (T048-T054) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: All User Stories After Foundation

```bash
# After Phase 2 (T006-T009) completes, launch user story implementations in parallel:
Task: "Implement User Story 1 - Authentication (T010-T018)"
Task: "Implement User Story 2 - Basic Chat (T019-T027)"
Task: "Implement User Story 3 - Message History (T028-T030)"
Task: "Implement User Story 4 - Error Handling (T031-T035)"
Task: "Implement User Story 5 - Responsive Mobile (T036-T040)"
Task: "Implement User Story 6 - Accessibility (T041-T047)"

# Then complete Polish phase:
Task: "Implement Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (T048-T060)"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T009) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Authentication (T010-T018)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Basic Chat (T019-T027)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test authentication and chat independently
   - User can register/login → Redirected to /chat
   - User can send message → AI responds
   - Messages displayed correctly
   - Token stored securely
   - Errors handled gracefully
6. Deploy/demo if ready (MVP complete!)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Authentication) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP Part 1)
3. Add User Story 2 (Basic Chat) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP Complete!)
4. Add User Story 3 (Message History) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Error Handling) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 (Responsive Mobile) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 6 (Accessibility) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
8. Each user story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T009)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication) - T010-T018
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Basic Chat) - T019-T027
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Message History) - T028-T030
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Error Handling) - T031-T035
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Responsive Mobile) - T036-T040
   - Developer F: User Story 6 (Accessibility) - T041-T047
3. User stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team collaborates on Polish phase (T048-T060)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent sections, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- All components use TypeScript for type safety
- All components use Tailwind CSS for styling
- All components follow Next.js 14+ App Router conventions
- All API calls use centralized API client with JWT handling
- All state management uses React Context + hooks
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate user story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
